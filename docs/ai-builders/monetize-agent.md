# Monitize Agent

You can monetize your Agent in two ways:

**On-chain Inference (Pay-per-Request):** In this model, users pay for each inference request individually. They are charged based on the results of the inference, providing a straightforward pay-per-use approach.

**Subscription-Based Model:** As an agent owner, you can create subscription plans for your agent by specifying the duration and the cost. Users can purchase these plans, and the funds will be deposited into an escrow account upon purchase. Payments are settled daily, with the settled amount transferred from the escrow account to the agent creatorâ€™s account.
