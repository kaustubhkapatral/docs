# Test And Validate

This guide focuses on using Arka Playground to test and refine your Agent. It covers creating a repository to manage your Agent's versions, deploying a Jupyter Notebook environment for development, and iterating on Agent logic by creating and registering multiple versions. You can also deploy specific versions for testing and further refinement.

## Playground

Visit [Playground](https://studio.arka.network), This will open the Playground website, where you can manage your Agent versions with ease.

**Steps:**

- Connect your wallet and ensure you have enough Arka tokens.
- Now goto `Hub` section. If the repository does not already exist, click on `Create Repository`.
- A form will open. Provide all the necessary details, including the repository name, description, image URL, 
repository type, privacy settings, metadata, and tags. Submit the form to create your repository.
- Now navigate to `Launch Notebook` page.
- Choose the necessary hardware specifications (e.g., CPU, GPU, RAM, storage) for your Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Click on `Deploy`: This will initiate a deployment request for the Jupyter Notebook environment..
- Allow some time for resource providers on the Arka network to pick up your deployment request.
- Once the environment is deployed successfully, you will receive an access URL and a notebook secret. Use these to access your Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Begin developing your Agent within the deployed Jupyter Notebook environment.
- Once your Agent code is complete, navigate to the Signing Notebook. This notebook contains detailed instructions and steps for:
  - Uploading the Agent code to IPFS
  - Registering on the Arka Network
